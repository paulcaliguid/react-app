  "body": "I’m Paul Timothy Deximo Caliguid, an aspiring agentic AI engineer and freelancer with a background in engineering and software development. Over the past few years I’ve helped design, build and test software products in corporate settings using Agile methodologies. I’m now shifting my focus to agentic artificial intelligence—creating autonomous agents that can perceive, decide and act to solve complex problems. My interests span prompt engineering, large language models, reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems. Leveraging experience with programming languages such as Python, JavaScript and Java, I enjoy exploring new technologies and applying them to real-world challenges. I’m open to opportunities that allow me to collaborate, learn and contribute to AI projects and to develop my skills as an agentic AI engineer in the service of others."
